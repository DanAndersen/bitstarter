						Wearable, always-on computing devices are becoming more and more prevalent. BuyMyEyes is a Web service and mobile app that allows live experiences to be easily monetized by connecting users of these new technologies with those who are interested in what those users are looking at, right now.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here's how it works: a BuyMyEyes seller sets up a profile and checks in to the service via the mobile web service, advertising that they are present in a particular area and offering their camera services for a certain amount of time. Buyers on BuyMyEyes can look up sellers by location and time, and find someone who is up for viewing what the buyer wants to view during that time. The buyer can negotiate a price (currently using Bitcoins) and set up a scheduled individual chat session to get live streaming video for an area.
					</p>

						Here's a quick example: Ann is an English teacher living in southern China, and owns a wearable camera system similar to Google Glass. Looking to make some additional income, she regularly checks in to her BuyMyEyes profile, noting her availability on weekdays from noon until 2 PM, in the city where she teaches, and some pre-determined prices for making use of her camera during that time.
					</p>
					<p>
						Charles is a potential buyer on BuyMeEyes, living in the United States. He could be planning a future trip to China, wanting to investigate some points of interest before he arrives. Or maybe he's researching park design and is dissatisfied with the videos he can find of the local parks and needs some specific shots. Or perhaps he works for a news agency and needs quick footage from the area. In any event, Charles goes onto BuyMyEyes and finds Ann's profile in a list of available sellers for her city. After selecting a time slot and negotiating a price and some details of what things Charles wants Ann to see, Charles logs into a video chat session with Ann, streaming video from Ann's Google Glass over a WebRTC connection. If Charles needs a closeup on a particular area, or wants to investigate a nearby shop from afar, he can use a microphone or type into the channel to be delivered as text-to-speech to Ann.

											Currently, web services with video are dominated by two very different use cases: recorded video that is uploaded and available only after recording (e.g. most YouTube services), or live video that is heavily tied to a single physical location and a non-moving camera (e.g. Skype or YouTube live streaming). Systems like Google Glass, when coupled with faster mobile connections, promise to change this by making it more convenient to record video live, on the go, and have it immediately viewable by interested parties.
										</p>
										<p>
											From the perspective of a buyer on BuyMyEyes, the sellers are not necessarily existing contacts (e.g. in Skype) or people who regularly create video shows on some subject (e.g. on YouTube). Rather, the sellers are valuable resources whose value derives from their being where the buyer wants to look, at some particular time.

											To get this project running, it is vital to focus on the experience when using a wearable camera device like Google Glass, to ensure bandwidth and streaming issues are solved in a proper way. Raised funds will go towards purchase and testing of such devices, as well as dedicated hosting for the BuyMyEyes service.
